%description
The marker_msgs package contains messages usable to setup a marker/fiducial
system. The package distinguishes between two types of messages. First messages
to describe the properties of a marker/fiducial detection system and the
detected markers. Secondly messages used to represent a map of markers/features
with covariances as it would be produced by a SLAM system or published by a map
server for self-localization.
